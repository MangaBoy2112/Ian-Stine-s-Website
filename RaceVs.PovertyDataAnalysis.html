   <h2> Analysis </h2>
  <p>TThrough analyzing the data we have collected we have noticed two things.
The first graph shows that over the years poverty has decreased for all races, although hispanic people are experiencing a rise in poverty.
The second graph that the poverty rate is highest for blacks and hispanics, and lowest for asians and whites.
We chose to represent the second graph in a pie chart to show proportionally how the races compare in terms of poverty rate.
This shows that people growing up in poverty are more likely to be in poverty themselves.
Our final visual displays the difference in the percentage of people in poverty according to their race. The photos of the man are proportional to each other. </p>
   
   <h2> conclusion </h2>
    <p>Throughout this project, we have learned many things. We have learned about how race affects how much money you make,
and how to chose how to display data. We discovered that line graphs are usually best when their is a time component, and pie charts when its proportional.
We have also learned through researching our topic the school to prison pipeline and have realized how lucky we are to go to a school like minnetonka.
