    <h1> How much pain will people withstand for M and Ms?</h1>
    <h2> Data Collection </h2>
    <p> To collect data we first asked around 46 people to stick their hand in 0 degree celcius water and for every 10 seconds in the <br>
     water, we gave them an m and m. We found that on average, people where able to have their hand in the icewater for 176.556 seconds.<br>
     Our next test was wall sits. Every twenty seconds people lasted, we gave them an m and m. We found that on average they lasted 250 seconds
    Finnally, we did planks. Every twenty seconds we gave them an m and m. We found that on average they lasted 102 seconds. </p>
    <h2> Data analysis </h2>
    <p>When we where testing the people putting their hands in icewater, we found that on average they lasted 176.556 seconds before the 10 seconds more was not worth the m and m.<br>
    When we where testing people on wall sits, we found that on average people lasted until 150 seconds in until 20 more seconds was not worth an m and m.<br>
    When we where testing people on planks, we found that people lasted an average of 102 seconds until an m and m was not worth 20 more seconds in pain.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>    We found out that most of the people got more m and ms from putting their hands in ice cold<br>
   water than from doing wall sits. This was partly caused by the fact that you got an m and ms every 10<br>
   seconds for putting your hand in ice water, and an m and ms for every 20 seconds you kept a wall sit.
